Neuroevolution: the use of evolutionary algorithms to generate and train neural networks.
Three types of neuroevolution:
  1.Evolve the arquitecutre of the neural network.
  2.Evolve the weights of the neural network.
  3.Evolve both the arquitecture and the weights of the neural network.
It can be used as an alternative to backpropagation.
